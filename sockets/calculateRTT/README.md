ClientRTT.c calculates the Rount Trip Time between two endpoints while also calculating the loss percentage of packets. 

This example can only be ran in a Linux enviornment (the time function that I am utilizin does not work in an OSX enviornment). 

Sample compilation: gcc -O3 -o clientRTT clientRTT.c
